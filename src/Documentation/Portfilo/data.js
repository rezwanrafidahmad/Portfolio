    desc : 'A multi-cloud application was developed to calculate risks using Monte Carlo Simulation on trading signals. The application utilized various cloud services and platforms, including AWS Lambda, EC2, RDS, and Google App Engine, to create a scalable and elastic Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) infrastructure. The aim was to enable efficient risk assessment and analysis for traders. Additionally, a cost analysis was conducted to compare the expenses associated with different cloud services, ensuring optimal resource allocation. The estimated operation costs were evaluated to make informed decisions regarding the selection of cloud services. This approach allowed for flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and reliable performance in the trading risk calculation process. HTML5/CSS3 were used for Front-End, and Python/Flask was used as backend for calculation.',
